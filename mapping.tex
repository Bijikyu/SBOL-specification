\section{Mapping Between SBOL 1, SBOL 2, and SBOL3}
\label{sec:mapping}

In broad strokes, the SBOL 1 standard focused on conveying physical, structural information, whereas SBOL 2 expanded the scope to include functional aspects as well.  
The physical information about a designed genetic construct includes the order of its constituents and their descriptions. 
Specifying the exact locations of these constituents and their sequences allows genetic constructs to be defined unambiguously and reused in other designs. 
SBOL 2 extended SBOL 1 in several ways: it extends physical descriptions to include entities beyond DNA sequences, and it added support for functional descriptions of designs.  
SBOL 3 refined the data model to simplify the representation of common use cases.

\subsection{Mapping between SBOL 1 and SBOL 2}

\ref{SBOL1TO2} depicts the mapping of SBOL 1.1 classes to SBOL 2.x classes, indicating corresponding classes/properties by color.
The SBOL 2.x \sbol{Model} and \sbol{CompenentDefinition} classes have no SBOL 1.1 equivalent, and thus are not shown.
In particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item SBOL 1.1 \external{Collection} objects containing \external{DnaComponent} objects map to SBOL 2.x \sbol{Collection} objects that contain \sbol{CompenentDefinition} objects with DNA \sbolmult{types:CD}{types} properties.
\item SBOL 1.1 \external{DnaComponent} objects maps to SBOL 2.x \sbol{CompenentDefinition} objects with DNA \sbolmult{types:CD}{types} properties.
\item SBOL 1.1 \external{DnaSequence} objects maps to an SBOL 2.x \sbol{Sequence} objects with \external{IUPAC DNA} \sbol{encoding} properties.
\item SBOL 1.1 \external{SequenceAnnotation} objects with \external{bioStart} and \external{bioEnd} properties map to SBOL 2.x\\
\sbol{SequenceAnnotation} objects that contain \sbol{Range} objects.
\item SBOL 1.1 \external{SequenceAnnotation} objects that lack \external{bioStart} and \external{bioEnd} properties map to an SBOL 2.x \sbol{SequenceFeature} objects that contain \sbol{GenericLocation} objects.
\item Each SBOL 1.1 \external{SequenceAnnotation} also maps to an SBOL 2.x \sbol{Component}, which represents the instantiation or usage of the appropriate \sbol{CompenentDefinition}.
\item Each SBOL 1.1 \external{precedes} property maps to an SBOL 2.x \sbol{SequenceConstraint} that specifies a precedes \sbol{restriction} property.
\end{itemize}
