# SBOL-specification

This repository contains the master specification document for the SBOL data model, formatted in LaTeX.  The workflow for updating the specification is to clone, edit, and submit a pull request on the master.

Members of the SBOL Development Community may use the issue tracker to flag problems with the existing specification and review ongoing issues under consideration.
