\section{Relation to other BBF RFCs}

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} replaces BBF RFC 108 (the SBOL 2.0 standard), as well as the minor update SBOL 2.0.1.

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} updates BBF RFC 30 (RDF-based framework for synthetic biology data), as it proposes a standard conforming to BBF RFC 30.

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} also implicitly supersedes the previously replaced BBF RFC 87 (SBOL 1.1, replaced by BBF RFC 108), BBF RFC 84 (SBOL 1.0, replaced by BBF RFC 87) and BBF RFC 31 (PoBoL, replaced by BBF RFC 84).
