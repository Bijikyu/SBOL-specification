\section{Relation to other BBF RFCs}

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} replaces BBF RFC 87 (the SBOL 1.1 standard).

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} updates BBF RFC 30 (RDF-based framework for synthetic biology data), as it proposes a standard conforming to BBF RFC 30.

BBF RFC \rfcnum{} also implicitly supersedes the previously replaced BBF RFC 84 (SBOL 1.0, replaced by BBF RFC 87) and BBF RFC 31 (PoBoL, replaced by BBF RFC 84).
