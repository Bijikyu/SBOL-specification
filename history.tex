In early 2006 Microsoft issued a call for proposals in the field of computational synthetic biology. A proposal was submitted from UW with the aim to kickstart an effort to develop exchange standards for designs in the new field of synthetic biology. Along with five other groups, the UW group was successful in securing a modest grant. Part of the funds were use to fund the initial standards meeting held in Seattle in April 26 to 27 in 2008. The organizers of the initial meeting were Herbert Sauro, Sean Sleight and Deep Chandran. The meeting included talks by Raik Gruenberg,  Kim de Mora from the Jason Kelly lab, John Cumbers,  Christopher Anderson, Mac Cowell, Jason Morrison, Jean Peccoud, Ralph Santos, Andrew Milar, Vincent Rouilly, Mike Hucka, Michael Blinov, Lucian Smith, Sarah Richardson, Guillermo Rodrigo, Jonathan Goler and last but not least Mike Galdzicki. Mike was to go on and lead the development of PoBol, as it was then called. Mike's early efforts were instrumental in making SBOL the success it is today. He organized annual workshops from 2008 to 2011 and kept the idea of developing a standard alive. The original SBOL 1.0 was developed through his efforts together withthe small group of dedicated researchers. An important meeting was held in 2011 at Blacksburg, Virginia on January 7-10, 2011 where new members joined the group and the over all pace of developed quickened. Its further development has continued at a series of subsequent open invitation workshops and through email exchanges on the SBOL Developers mailing list. Finally, afte repeated attempts, the SBOL core team finally secured federal funding from the National Science Foundation. This document is partly a result of that support.
